# REST_Server

REST Server implementation with CORS support to streamline API creation.

This is a plug-and-play library meant to fit most web applications utilizing PHP as the server-sided scripting language. However, for best results, the use of an Apache-based server is desired. If you plan to use this library on a non-apache-based server, please replace values being returned to the `_request` property branching off of the `_init` method with your server's version of the variables (or use your own clever way to get the necessary result).

Documentation will be available shortly
